Several outlets frame the move as a direct response to the “power crunch” and grid-connection bottlenecks that can delay new data centers, with Intersect positioned as a developer that can help line up power and sites more quickly [techcrunch.com#1][google.com#2][nytimes.com#1].

The group frames the effort as a “preservation archive” and says the audio set covers 99.6% of listening activity on Spotify, even though it represents only a portion of the full catalog [engadget.com#1][androidheadlines.com#1][futurism.com#1]. Spotify says it identified and disabled accounts involved in what it calls unlawful scraping, and says it has added safeguards and is monitoring for suspicious behavior [techcrunch.com#1][pcmag.com#1][futurism.com#1][androidauthority.com#1].
