    "summary": "A cluster of year-end reports says 2025’s AI surge substantially increased fortunes at the top of US tech, with the Financial Times estimating about $500bn added to US tech billionaires’ net worth and Forbes and Gizmodo separately reporting that AI created more than 50 new billionaires this year [ft.com#1][google.com#5][gizmodo.com#1]. Alongside the money story, MIT Technology Review framed 2025 as a vocabulary-building year for the public, spotlighting 14 hard-to-escape AI terms as new products and practices spread quickly across the industry [technologyreview.com#1]. Looking ahead to 2026, several outlets emphasize a two-sided reality: leaders see competitive upside if organizations operationalize AI well, while IT and security watchers warn that AI-linked cyber risk and organizational stress may rise as adoption accelerates [google.com#2][ft.com#2][google.com#4][google.com#8].",

    "historical_background": "Nvidia has spent the past decade evolving from a graphics-chip company into a central supplier for AI computing, with its GPUs becoming a standard choice for training and deploying modern AI models [common]. As AI workloads shifted from experimentation to production, faster and cheaper “inference” became a key battleground, encouraging both startups and incumbents to design specialized chips and systems [common]. The reported Groq asset purchase fits into that arc by aiming to add more inference-focused capability inside Nvidia’s broader AI platform strategy [investing.com#1].",
