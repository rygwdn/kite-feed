The company describes CLOiD as a humanoid-style home assistant with two articulated arms and five individually actuated fingers on each hand, designed for a “wide range” of indoor chores [mashable.com#1][engadget.com#1][theverge.com#1]. LG also says CLOiD runs on its AI (including what it calls “Affectionate Intelligence”) and is intended to become more personalized through repeated interactions, using onboard sensors plus a camera, speaker, display, and a head-housed chipset for navigation and communication [mashable.com#1][engadget.com#1][androidheadlines.com#1]. Key details remain under wraps ahead of the show, including pricing, release timing, and even full images—highlighting how CES reveals can range from near-term products to longer-term concepts [mashable.com#1][engadget.com#1][theverge.com#1].",

    "summary": "Thailand and Cambodia signed an “immediate” ceasefire on December 27 to halt weeks of deadly fighting along their disputed border, with the truce taking effect at noon local time [france24.com#2][abc.net.au#1][theguardian.com#1][npr.org#1]. In a joint statement, the two governments said the halt covers “all types of weapons,” including attacks on civilians, civilian sites and infrastructure, and military targets across all affected areas [france24.com#2][theguardian.com#1][cbsnews.com#1]. The deal aims to stop escalation that has included heavy weapons and air power, and it comes after several days of talks while clashes were still being reported [dawn.com#1][pbs.org#1][apnews.com#1]. While casualty and displacement figures vary by outlet and official tallies, multiple reports describe widespread civilian disruption on both sides of the frontier, making the ceasefire a potentially hopeful opening for relief and longer-term de-escalation [france24.com#1][bbc.com#1][dawn.com#1].",
