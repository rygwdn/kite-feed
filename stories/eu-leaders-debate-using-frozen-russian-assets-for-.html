    <h1>EU leaders debate using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine aid</h1>
<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> World</p>
<div class='summary'><p>European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels to decide whether to back a large multi‑year financing package for Ukraine that would be underpinned by income from about €210–€246 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets held mainly in Belgium’s Euroclear system [bbc.com#1][rt.com#1][semafor.com#1]. The European Commission has proposed raising roughly €90 billion through a so‑called “reparations loan” for 2026‑27, which Ukraine would only have to reimburse if Russia later pays war damages, a plan strongly supported by Germany, Nordic and eastern member states who argue it is essential to keep Kyiv’s economy and defence functioning [rt.com#1][theguardian.com#2][rfi.fr#1]. Belgium, Italy and several smaller states worry that seizing or leveraging Russian sovereign funds could breach international legal norms, undermine confidence in euro‑denominated assets and expose EU institutions or Euroclear to costly lawsuits or retaliation from Moscow [rt.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1][politico.eu#1]. Moscow has condemned any use of its frozen reserves as “theft” and threatened legal and other countermeasures, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Brussels urging leaders to move ahead, warning that failure to act would be a “big problem” for Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia’s ongoing offensive [rt.com#1][france24.com#1][dawn.com#1]. At the same time, Ukrainian officials say President Trump’s administration is pressuring European capitals not to tap the assets, reportedly seeing them as leverage for possible future negotiations with Russia and for a US‑led reconstruction plan, adding another layer of geopolitical tension to the summit [france24.com#2][dawn.com#1][straitstimes.com#2].</p></div>
<blockquote><p>If we don’t make a decision, it is a big problem for us, for Ukraine</p><cite>— Volodymyr Zelenskyy (France 24)</cite></blockquote>
<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> Most of the immobilised Russian central bank funds in Europe are clustered in a single institution, Belgium‑based Euroclear, rather than being spread evenly across EU banks [rt.com#1][semafor.com#1].</p></div>
<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Asset scale: Around €200–210 billion in Russian central bank reserves have been immobilised in the EU since Moscow’s full‑scale invasion in 2022, with most of the funds parked at the Euroclear securities depository in Belgium [rt.com#1][dawn.com#1][semafor.com#1].</li>
<li>Proposed loan design: Under the European Commission’s preferred design, revenue generated by investing the frozen Russian assets would service a large loan for Ukraine’s budget and military needs over the next two years, and Ukraine would only repay the principal if Russia eventually provides reparations [rt.com#1][theguardian.com#2][rfi.fr#1].</li>
<li>Member state split: Germany and many Nordic and eastern EU countries insist there is “no better option” than basing Ukraine aid on Russian assets, while Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Malta object and instead promote borrowing backed by the EU budget as a fallback [theguardian.com#1][politico.eu#1][abcnews.go.com#1].</li>
<li>Belgium’s concerns: Belgium, where Euroclear is headquartered, demands ironclad guarantees that any legal or retaliatory costs from Russia will be shared across the bloc, arguing that the host state of the assets should not shoulder disproportionate risk [abcnews.go.com#1][rt.com#1].</li>
<li>Pressure on timing: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other leaders say they “will not leave” the Brussels summit without a Ukraine funding deal, stressing that without fresh European money Ukraine could face a budget shortfall of around $160 billion over the next two years [france24.com#1][rt.com#1][semafor.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perspectives</h2>
<div class='perspective'><p>European Commission: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has argued that using profits from frozen Russian assets for a Ukraine loan is a legally sound way to secure long‑term support while signalling EU unity against Russian aggression.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>Belgian government: Belgium stresses that while it does not rule out using the assets, it wants comprehensive legal guarantees and burden‑sharing mechanisms before approving any scheme that could expose Euroclear and the host country to Russian lawsuits or hybrid retaliation.</p>

<div class='perspective'><p>Ukrainian leadership: President Zelenskyy and senior Ukrainian officials urge Europeans to mobilise the frozen assets quickly, arguing this would both cover Kyiv’s looming budget gap and discourage what they describe as Moscow’s continued “appetite for war.”.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>
<li><strong>February 2022:</strong> Russia’s full‑scale invasion prompts EU and partners to freeze major Russian reserves [dawn.com#1][rt.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban states Russian assets issue “will not be on the table” at summit [rt.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Senior Ukrainian official claims US administration is pressuring Europeans not to use frozen assets [france24.com#2][dawn.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Thursday:</strong> EU leaders convene in Brussels to seek agreement on Ukraine funding structure for 2026‑27 [france24.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>
<li>Frozen sovereign assets: Frozen sovereign assets are central bank or state‑owned funds that have been immobilised by sanctions, meaning Russia’s central bank cannot move or use its roughly €200‑plus billion held in EU financial institutions though the money remains legally owned by Moscow [rt.com#1][semafor.com#1].</li>
<li>Reparations loan mechanism: The proposed EU “reparations loan” would raise market funding for Ukraine using investment income from Russian assets as collateral, with repayment of the principal contingent on Russia eventually paying war reparations, a design intended to shift the financial burden away from EU taxpayers over time [rt.com#1][theguardian.com#2].</li>
<li>Euroclear’s role: Euroclear, a Belgium‑based securities depository, holds most of the immobilised Russian central bank assets and would continue managing them under any scheme, which is why Belgian authorities are particularly concerned about legal exposure and potential Russian countermeasures [rt.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>
<li>European financial services: Large custodians and clearing systems such as Euroclear face heightened legal and operational risk if Russian sovereign funds are used, prompting calls from Belgium for EU‑wide guarantees that could change how the bloc allocates liability in future sanctions regimes [rt.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1].</li>
<li>Global reserve management: Central banks worldwide are likely to watch the EU decision closely, as a move to actively deploy frozen reserves could influence how governments diversify away from currencies or jurisdictions they perceive as more willing to weaponise official assets [rt.com#1][semafor.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>After Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU, G7 and partners froze large portions of the Russian central bank’s foreign reserves held in their jurisdictions as part of coordinated sanctions [dawn.com#1][rt.com#1]. Since then, European governments have repeatedly debated whether those immobilised assets or the income they generate could be used to support Ukraine’s reconstruction or war effort without violating international law or destabilising trust in reserve currencies [rfi.fr#1][semafor.com#1].</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is Italy sceptical of using Russian assets while still supporting Ukraine aid?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said she backs financial support for Kyiv but wants detailed answers on the “possible risks” of leveraging Russian central bank reserves, preferring an alternative based on EU‑guaranteed common debt rather than tying aid directly to sanctioned funds [politico.eu#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the proposed EU loan relate to earlier promises of support to Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The planned €90 billion Ukraine facility for 2026‑27 is intended to follow on from earlier multi‑year EU macro‑financial packages and would aim to ensure that European funds can sustain Ukraine’s economy and military even as US assistance has stalled [rt.com#1][semafor.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What forms of retaliation has Russia hinted at beyond legal action?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Russian officials and commentators have warned of unspecified “hybrid warfare” and other non‑military countermeasures, in addition to lawsuits, if the EU moves from freezing to using its sovereign assets to underwrite Ukraine financing [rt.com#1][semafor.com#1].</p>
