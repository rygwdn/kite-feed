    <h1>Trump defends economic record in prime-time national address</h1>
<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> World</p>
<div class='summary'><p>US President Donald Trump used a rare prime-time address from the White House on Wednesday, December 17, to claim his administration has quickly begun fixing what he called an economic, border and security &quot;mess&quot; inherited from his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.[rt.com#1][dawn.com#1][france24.com#1] He argued that inflation and living costs are now easing thanks to his policies, even as polls show a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the economy and remain anxious about affordability.[lemonde.fr#1][semafor.com#1][france24.com#2] Trump highlighted falling prices for items such as fuel and air travel, pledged an &quot;economic boom&quot; in 2026, and promoted tariffs, immigration crackdowns and a new &quot;big, beautiful bill&quot; as the engines of future growth.[rt.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][semafor.com#1] The speech offered few new policy details but included a promised one-off &quot;warrior dividend&quot; payment of $1,776 to about 1.45 million service members, and was widely read as a bid to reframe his first year back in office ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.[dawn.com#1][firstpost.com#1][france24.com#1]</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it</p><cite>— President Donald Trump (Dawn)</cite></blockquote>
<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> Trump’s televised address lasted under 20 minutes and was delivered in what reporters described as a rapid-fire style, shorter and more condensed than many previous prime-time presidential speeches.[dawn.com#1][scmp.com#1]</p></div>
<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Immigration focus: Trump claimed his administration has effectively sealed the southern border, saying no irregular migrants had been allowed in for months and that increased deportations of people with criminal records had restored safety in major cities, crediting executive actions rather than new laws for the shift.[rt.com#1][dawn.com#1][aljazeera.com#2]</li>
<li>Tariffs and investment: He framed higher tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic strategy, asserting that they had spurred trillions of dollars in private-sector investment and a manufacturing revival in sectors from automobiles to artificial intelligence.[rt.com#1]</li>
<li>Healthcare proposal: Trump endorsed a Republican plan to send cash directly to individuals so they can buy their own health insurance, arguing this would bypass Affordable Care Act subsidies and reduce the role of insurance companies, although the idea has not yet secured enough support in Congress.[dawn.com#1]</li>
<li>Public opinion gap: Despite the upbeat message, recent polling cited by foreign media indicates around 57% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s economic management and his overall approval rating has fallen to its lowest level since returning to office.[lemonde.fr#1][semafor.com#1]</li>
<li>Campaign overtones: Several outlets noted that the 18- to 20-minute, combative address echoed Trump’s rally themes and functioned as an early pitch for Republicans facing a difficult 2026 midterm map, rather than laying out a detailed new governing program.[france24.com#1][scmp.com#1][firstpost.com#1]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perspectives</h2>
<div class='perspective'><p>President Trump: He portrayed the United States as &quot;the hottest country anywhere&quot; economically, insisted that inflation had stopped and wages now outpace price rises, and promised an &quot;economic boom&quot; in 2026 that he said would be unmatched globally.[dw.com#1][rt.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][lemonde.fr#1].</p>

</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>Opposition Democrats: Democratic critics, as summarized by international outlets, argue that Trump is downplaying ongoing high prices, blaming immigrants and his predecessor for current problems while offering limited new concrete measures on affordability.[dawn.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][france24.com#2].</p>

<div class='perspective'><p>Independent pollsters: Polling data highlighted by Le Monde and Semafor shows a majority of respondents critical of Trump’s handling of the economy and indicates growing disapproval despite his claims of progress.[lemonde.fr#1][semafor.com#1].</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>
<li><strong>January 20, 2025:</strong> Trump is inaugurated for a new term, inheriting an economy with elevated inflation.[common][dawn.com#1]</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, December 17, 2025:</strong> He delivers an 18- to 20-minute prime-time address defending his first year.[dawn.com#1][scmp.com#1][semafor.com#1]</li>
<li><strong>Thursday, December 18, 2025:</strong> International outlets report new polling showing majority disapproval of his economic management.[lemonde.fr#1][semafor.com#1]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>
<li>Warrior dividend: The &quot;warrior dividend&quot; is a one-time cash payment of $1,776 that Trump said will be sent to around 1.45 million US service members in the coming week, framed as a reward for their service and funded through federal action his administration did not fully detail in the speech.[dawn.com#1]</li>
<li>Tariff-driven reshoring: Trump presented his tariff policy as a tool to encourage companies to move production back to the US, claiming it has already attracted trillions in investment and boosted manufacturing, though the address did not provide specific sector-by-sector evidence for those figures.[rt.com#1]</li>
<li>Direct health subsidies: The Republican-backed healthcare idea Trump promoted would replace Affordable Care Act-style subsidies with direct cash payments to households, shifting purchasing decisions toward individuals and away from exchange-based plans, but it faces political obstacles in Congress and remains a proposal rather than enacted law.[dawn.com#1]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>
<li>Manufacturing and reshoring: If tariffs and investment incentives continue, firms in sectors like autos and AI hardware that relocate or expand production in the US could see higher capital spending in the near term but may gain longer-run resilience from shorter supply chains and domestic demand.[rt.com#1]</li>
<li>Healthcare and insurance: The proposed shift from insurance subsidies to direct cash for buying coverage, if ever enacted, could reshape the US health insurance market by pushing insurers to compete more directly on price and service for individual customers, while creating uncertainty for providers that rely on current Affordable Care Act structures.[dawn.com#1]</li>
<li>Defense and military households: The one-off warrior dividend would inject billions of dollars into the finances of service members and their families in a short window, providing a modest demand boost for local businesses in communities with large military populations.[dawn.com#1][common]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Trump returned to the presidency in January 2025 after defeating Democrat Joe Biden in the 2024 election, reclaiming the office he had previously held from 2017 to 2021.[common] During Biden’s term, the United States experienced a spike in inflation linked by many economists to pandemic-era supply shocks, strong post‑pandemic demand, and energy price volatility, creating a cost-of-living backdrop that both Trump and his critics now invoke when assessing his first year back in office.[common][ft.com#1]</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What specific measures did Trump highlight in his &quot;big, beautiful bill&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Trump referenced a &quot;big, beautiful bill&quot; in his remarks but, according to coverage from Semafor, did not detail its full contents beyond suggesting it would deliver economic benefits and feed into more ambitious housing reforms planned for the new year.[semafor.com#1]</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How did Trump’s address treat foreign policy issues like Venezuela and Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> RT reported that the speech focused on the domestic economy, border enforcement and claimed foreign policy successes while making no mention of rising tensions with Venezuela or efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.[rt.com#1]</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What role did immigration play in Trump’s explanation for economic problems?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Several outlets noted that Trump blamed immigrants for some of the country’s challenges, linking border crossings and what he called a previously &quot;chaotic&quot; border to economic and social strain, even as he argued his enforcement policies had now restored order.[aljazeera.com#1][dawn.com#1]</p>
