<h1>Oracle shares tumble as investors question AI data center plans</h1>




<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> Technology</p>







<div class='summary'><p>Oracle’s stock slid sharply this quarter, marking its steepest quarterly drop since 2001, as investors weigh whether the company can scale up data-center capacity quickly enough for major AI ambitions tied to OpenAI-related demand <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. Coverage points to a mix of worries—delayed AI infrastructure projects, higher borrowing, and results that came in below expectations—colliding just as Oracle recently installed new co-CEOs <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Oracle has also outlined a big capacity expansion plan that includes significantly higher spending and long-term lease commitments, a sign it’s trying to build for future cloud growth even as markets debate the near-term costs <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</p></div>

<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> The most power-constrained part of modern data-center expansion is often securing enough electricity and grid interconnection, not just buying servers [common].</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Debt spotlight: Investors have focused on leverage as Oracle pairs its expansion push with financing and long-term commitments, which some coverage frames as a key driver of the selloff <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>New leadership: Oracle’s leadership transition—naming Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as new CEOs—has drawn extra scrutiny because the stock decline has come early in their tenure <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Spending ramp: Oracle said it plans to lift capital expenditures to about $50 billion in fiscal 2026 as part of boosting cloud capacity <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

<li>Lease commitments: The company also disclosed roughly $248 billion in lease commitments tied to expanding cloud capacity, underscoring how much infrastructure it expects to need <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

<li>Dot-com echoes: Some analysts and commentary have compared the mood to dot-com-era anxiety, citing delayed projects and weaker earnings as reasons investors are revisiting old fears <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Perspectives</h2>


<div class='perspective'><p>Oracle (expansion posture): Oracle has laid out plans to sharply increase spending and commit to large lease obligations to expand cloud capacity, signaling an aggressive build-out strategy for future demand.</p>

</p>

</div>



<div class='perspective'><p>Market skeptics (execution risk): Skepticism centers on whether Oracle can open and scale enough data centers fast enough to support AI-related demand, with delays and financing concerns weighing on sentiment.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Data center build-out: A data center build-out involves acquiring sites, power, networking, and servers/accelerators, then bringing facilities online fast enough to meet customer demand; the articles frame execution speed as a central concern for Oracle’s AI ambitions <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Capital expenditures (capex): Capex is money spent on long-lived assets like buildings and servers; Oracle signaled a major capex step-up for fiscal 2026 as part of expanding cloud capacity <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

<li>Lease commitments: Large lease commitments typically reflect long-term contracts for facilities and equipment; Oracle disclosed a very large total lease commitment figure as it scales capacity <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>AI infrastructure suppliers: If Oracle proceeds with the scale of spending it outlined, it could support sustained demand for data-center construction, power, and leased infrastructure capacity across the supply chain <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

<li>Cloud competition: Oracle’s planned capacity expansion signals intensifying competition in cloud infrastructure as AI workloads drive companies to add more compute and facilities <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Enterprise buyers: For enterprise customers, a successful build-out could broaden options for AI-capable cloud capacity; concerns about project delays highlight why buyers often prioritize delivery timelines and reliability in vendor selection <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

</ul>







<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Oracle is best known for its long-running enterprise database franchise and, over the past decade, has tried to expand deeper into cloud infrastructure and applications to compete with hyperscalers [common]. The company’s shares last saw a similarly steep quarterly slide in 2001, during the aftermath of the dot-com bust, making the current drop a historically notable moment for long-term shareholders <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>







<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What kinds of AI workloads are expected to drive the additional cloud capacity Oracle is planning?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The articles discuss AI-driven demand tied to data-center expansion and OpenAI-related needs but do not specify particular workload types beyond AI infrastructure growth <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/251226/p8#a251226p8" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How will Oracle fund the planned fiscal 2026 capex increase without materially changing its balance-sheet risk?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The coverage highlights investor concerns about debt alongside the planned spending increase, but it does not lay out a detailed funding mix in these summaries <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/news/oracle-shares-face-worst-decline-since-2001-on-debt-concerns" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which specific projects were delayed, and what timelines were given for completion?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> One article references delayed AI infrastructure projects as a concern, but the provided coverage does not enumerate specific projects or delivery dates <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracles-ai-push-is-leading-to-its-worst-quarter-since-2001-2000703605" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p>
