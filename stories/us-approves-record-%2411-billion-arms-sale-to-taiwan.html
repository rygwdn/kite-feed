    <h1>US approves record $11 billion arms sale to Taiwan</h1>
<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> World</p>
<div class='summary'><p>The US State Department has approved a weapons package for Taiwan worth around $11–11.1 billion, described as the largest US arms sale to the self-governed island to date [aljazeera.com#1][japantoday.com#1][dawn.com#1]. The proposed deal, announced during President Trump’s current term, includes multiple contracts for HIMARS rocket launchers, ATACMS and other medium‑range missiles, self‑propelled howitzers, Javelin anti‑tank systems, loitering drones, and various parts and software to modernize Taiwan’s defenses [rt.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1][dawn.com#1]. Washington says the move supports its longstanding policy of helping Taiwan maintain a “credible defensive capability” and strengthen asymmetric warfare tactics aimed at deterring attacks, which US and Taiwanese officials argue underpins regional peace and stability [dawn.com#1][rt.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1]. Taiwan’s government, facing increasing military pressure and drills from Beijing, welcomed the announcement as part of broader efforts to boost defence spending and “safeguard peace through strength,” while China condemned the sale and urged the US to stop arming what it sees as its own territory [dawn.com#1][lemonde.fr#1][france24.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1].</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Our country will continue to promote defence reforms, strengthen whole-of-society defence resilience, demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves, and safeguard peace through strength</p><cite>— Karen Kuo, spokesperson for Taiwan’s presidential office (Dawn)</cite></blockquote>
<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> The high‑mobility artillery rocket systems heading to Taiwan are similar to those the US sent to Ukraine earlier in the decade, where they gained attention for their long‑range precision strikes [theglobeandmail.com#1].</p></div>
<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Package composition: The eight separate sales cover 82 HIMARS launchers, about 420 ATACMS missiles, roughly 60 self‑propelled howitzers, Javelin anti‑tank weapons, Altius loitering munitions, and assorted parts and software, with rocket and howitzer systems together accounting for more than $8 billion of the value [rt.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1][dawn.com#1].</li>
<li>Procedural stage: The deal sits at the congressional notification stage, meaning US lawmakers now have an opportunity to review, block, or modify individual components before any contracts are finalized and deliveries arranged [rt.com#1][dawn.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1].</li>
<li>Taiwan’s wider buildup: Taiwan’s president recently proposed a supplementary defence budget of about $40 billion running from 2026 to 2030, signalling a long‑term plan to invest heavily in deterrence alongside this US package [dawn.com#1].</li>
<li>US policy framing: The Pentagon says the sales align with US national, economic and security interests by supporting Taiwan’s armed forces modernization and helping it field smaller, mobile, and relatively low‑cost systems suited for asymmetric warfare [dawn.com#1][rt.com#1].</li>
<li>Cross‑party backing: Taiwan’s defence ministry notes that arms purchases from the US generally enjoy broad, cross‑party political support within the island’s legislature, suggesting domestic approval is unlikely to be a major hurdle [dawn.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perspectives</h2>
<div class='perspective'><p>Taiwan government: Taiwan’s defence ministry said the US continues to help the island rapidly build strong deterrent power and asymmetric advantages, calling these the foundation of maintaining regional peace and stability as it faces sustained pressure from Beijing.</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> 
<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1961826/us-approves-111-billion-arms-package-for-taiwan">dawn.com</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>Taiwan presidential office: The presidential office framed the purchase as part of wider defence reforms and efforts to strengthen society‑wide resilience, saying Taiwan is determined to defend itself and protect peace by demonstrating credible strength.</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> 
<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1961826/us-approves-111-billion-arms-package-for-taiwan">dawn.com</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>US administration: The Pentagon and State Department argue the package advances US national, economic, and security interests by backing Taiwan’s modernization and preserving a credible defensive posture rather than altering the regional military balance offensively.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>Chinese government: Beijing demanded Washington immediately stop arming Taiwan, saying the newly approved arms package undermines China’s sovereignty and interferes in its internal affairs under its position that the island is part of Chinese territory.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>
<li><strong>November:</strong> US and Taiwan completed an earlier $330 million deal for aircraft spare and repair parts [rt.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Last month:</strong> President Lai Ching‑te announced a supplementary defence budget of about $40 billion from 2026 [dawn.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> The US State Department unveiled the new multi‑billion‑dollar Taiwan arms package in eight parts [japantoday.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Taiwan confirmed the approval and China publicly demanded Washington stop arming the island [france24.com#1][firstpost.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>
<li>HIMARS rocket system: The high‑mobility artillery rocket system is a truck‑mounted launcher that can rapidly fire precision‑guided rockets over significant distances, giving Taiwan a mobile platform for striking targets while remaining harder to detect and destroy than fixed batteries [rt.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
<li>ATACMS medium‑range missiles: Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) are longer‑range missiles compatible with HIMARS that can hit high‑value targets such as airfields or command posts, expanding Taiwan’s ability to respond to threats without matching China’s larger arsenal platform‑for‑platform [rt.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
<li>Asymmetric warfare: Asymmetric warfare in this context refers to Taiwan focusing on smaller, mobile, and relatively low‑cost systems like drones, anti‑tank missiles, and rocket artillery designed to impose high costs on a stronger adversary rather than attempting to mirror its scale, an approach both US and Taiwanese officials highlight as key to deterrence [dawn.com#1][rt.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>
<li>Global defence suppliers: Large US weapons makers that produce rocket systems, artillery, and drones gain another multi‑billion‑dollar order stream in the Indo‑Pacific, reinforcing the region’s role as a growth market for advanced conventional arms [theglobeandmail.com#1][dawn.com#1].</li>
<li>Regional security dynamics: The move may prompt further procurement by neighbours concerned about cross‑strait stability, as governments in East Asia reassess stockpiles and deterrence strategies in light of China’s increasing military activity around Taiwan [abc.net.au#1][ft.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Since the late 1970s, the United States has supplied Taiwan with defensive weaponry under the Taiwan Relations Act, even after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing [common]. In recent years, China has increased military flights and naval activities around the island, while successive US administrations have expanded arms sales and high‑level contacts, contributing to a pattern of periodic tension spikes between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan’s status [dawn.com#1][ft.com#1].</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does this arms package compare with previous US sales to Taiwan in scope and systems?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Earlier recent sales focused more on aircraft parts and smaller systems, whereas this package combines long‑range rocket artillery, heavy howitzers, anti‑tank missiles, and loitering drones in a single, multi‑billion‑dollar bundle that Taiwan and several outlets describe as its largest‑ever purchase from the US [rt.com#1][dawn.com#1][japantoday.com#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What role does Taiwan’s legislature play in implementing these purchases?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> After US congressional review, Taiwan’s own authorities need to budget, contract, and integrate the systems, a process its defence ministry notes typically proceeds smoothly as US arms acquisitions usually enjoy broad, cross‑party backing on the island [dawn.com#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Could US lawmakers significantly alter the composition of the package during notification?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In theory Congress can block or modify individual sale items at the notification stage, but such interventions are rare for Taiwan packages that already reflect consultations between the executive branch, industry, and key members of Congress [dawn.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1][common].</p>
