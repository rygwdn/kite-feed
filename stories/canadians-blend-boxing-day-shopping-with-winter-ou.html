<div class='summary'><p>Across Canada, Boxing Day 2025 looked less like a dawn rush and more like a mix of deal-seeking and getting out of the house during wintry weather <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/calgarians-flock-to-malls-for-boxing-day-deals-and-a-break-from-the-cold" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-boxing-day-sales-retail-revenue-growth-market-spending/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/boxing-day-draws-shoppers-despite-poor-weather-in-toronto-much-of-ontario-11671525" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>. In Calgary, some families treated the mall as a warm place to spend time together while picking up post-Christmas discounts <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/calgarians-flock-to-malls-for-boxing-day-deals-and-a-break-from-the-cold" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. In downtown Vancouver, crowds still filled Robson Street, but the day’s feel was described as more about togetherness than the once-famous door-crasher frenzy <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. Edmonton retailers and observers said online shopping and earlier sale events have helped turn Dec. 26 into a more typical holiday shopping day for many stores <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p></div>

<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> Boxing Day falls on Dec. 26 and coincides with St. Stephen’s Day traditions linked to charitable giving in the U.K. <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Cold-weather resolve: Shoppers in Toronto and other parts of Ontario headed out despite heavy snow and wintry conditions, showing that in-person bargain hunting still has pull even when the forecast does not cooperate <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/boxing-day-draws-shoppers-despite-poor-weather-in-toronto-much-of-ontario-11671525" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

<li>Prairie mall crush: In Winnipeg, shoppers lined up outside an overcapacity Bath &amp; Body Works outlet at Polo Park and some reported long parking delays before reaching the sales inside <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-boxing-day-sales-retail-revenue-growth-market-spending/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>.</li>

<li>Inventory shifts: Some Edmonton stores said they had fewer items left to mark down because retailers have been managing inventory more carefully, changing what “Boxing Day deals” look like on the ground <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Why it changed: A University of Toronto marketing professor attributed the mellowing of Boxing Day to the rise of online purchasing and the holiday’s reduced role as a leftover-inventory clear-out <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Origins remembered: Boxing Day traces back to the U.K. and St. Stephen’s Day traditions of giving to those in need, including Victorian-era “boxing up” of food, money and gifts for poorer neighbours <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Perspectives</h2>


<div class='perspective'><p>Calgary shoppers and families: Some people came for discounts, but also to turn mall time into a family outing and a break from staying indoors during freezing temperatures.</p>

</p>

</div>



<div class='perspective'><p>Vancouver observers: The day was portrayed as evolving away from intense bargain-hunting toward a more social, feel-good holiday moment downtown, with fewer lineups and more emphasis on being together.</p>

</p>

</div>



<div class='perspective'><p>Edmonton retailers and analysts: Store staff and a marketing professor described Boxing Day as increasingly similar to an average shopping day, influenced by consumers shifting to online buying and earlier seasonal sales.</p>

<div class='perspective'><p>Deal-focused shoppers in multiple cities: Some consumers still treated Boxing Day as worth the effort—queuing at busy outlets or heading out in difficult conditions to find discounts in person.</p>

<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Malls as community spaces: In Calgary, shoppers described malls as a practical place to spend time together and escape the cold, reinforcing the idea that physical retail can compete by offering comfort, food, and a social outing—not only low prices <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/calgarians-flock-to-malls-for-boxing-day-deals-and-a-break-from-the-cold" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Promotions calendar: Commentary from Vancouver and Edmonton highlighted how Black Friday, Cyber Monday and online deals have pulled attention away from Dec. 26, reshaping how retailers distribute promotions and consumer traffic through the season <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a><a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Operations planning: Reports of heavy crowds at specific outlets (like an overcapacity Bath &amp; Body Works in Winnipeg) alongside quieter big-box openings in Edmonton suggest demand is concentrating in certain brands/categories, which can influence leasing, staffing, and security decisions for shopping centres <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-boxing-day-sales-retail-revenue-growth-market-spending/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

</ul>







<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Boxing Day originated in the U.K. as a day tied to St. Stephen’s Day and traditions of charity, including alms boxes and later Victorian-era practice of boxing up food, money and gifts for people in need <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. In Canada, the holiday broadened into “Boxing Week,” remaining important for retailers even as shopping habits and sale calendars have shifted <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p>







<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much has Black Friday and Cyber Monday changed the timing of Canadian holiday sales?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The Vancouver Sun and Edmonton Journal both describe Black Friday/Cyber Monday and early online deals as replacing much of the old Boxing Day “door-crasher” moment, spreading promotions earlier in the season <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a><a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why were some stores busy while others stayed quiet?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The Edmonton Journal reported quiet early hours at a Best Buy and noted only certain stores (like Sephora) were busy at one mall, while the Globe described intense crowds at a specific outlet in Winnipeg—suggesting demand varied by retailer and category <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/boxing-day-has-become-just-another-average-shopping-day" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-boxing-day-sales-retail-revenue-growth-market-spending/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What’s the difference between Boxing Day and “Boxing Week” in Canada?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The Vancouver Sun notes that in Canada the holiday has evolved into “Boxing Week,” meaning sales and shopping activity can stretch beyond Dec. 26 rather than concentrating in a single day <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/today-boxing-day-is-more-about-time-with-loved-ones-than-finding-bargains" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p>

</div>






<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Make a “need vs. nice-to-have” list before Boxing Week browsing: Use a short list (e.g., replacement items like a TV or winter clothing) to keep deal-hunting focused, reflecting how shoppers described targeting specific categories while out with family <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/calgarians-flock-to-malls-for-boxing-day-deals-and-a-break-from-the-cold" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Plan travel time if shopping in severe weather: If your area is seeing heavy snow or wintry conditions, build extra time into your trip and consider delaying non-urgent errands, as Ontario shoppers faced poor weather on Boxing Day <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/boxing-day-draws-shoppers-despite-poor-weather-in-toronto-much-of-ontario-11671525" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>
