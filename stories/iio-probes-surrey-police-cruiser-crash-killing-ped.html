<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> Canada</p>







<div class='summary'><p>A woman died after being struck by a Surrey Police Service vehicle in Whalley, Surrey, on Christmas morning, and B.C.’s Independent Investigations Office (IIO) has opened an investigation <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://news.google.com/atom/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOOGZSNVhDbzJFajVPR1NaY2dUNjA2dDg2bHlGdi0xQ3laOGJlNFNJRW1qd3JaM0dmWjBSNEswTUltYi1BXzd4YURMNmlpeXZwYkRfeWxkR2dJSXZPbjg1WG9EN1gtUThieU1kX1UyMFJIUi0tZUhhdnc5QndLX2pRV3V3ZzkwOTd5aFJJM24zQ0J6b2E1X2hDWg" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/british-columbia/female-pedestrian-killed-in-crash-with-surrey-police-vehicle-leaving-gas-station/article_5b5f874b-5eb0-5e23-8a6e-5e5ba5a19f01.html" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a><a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/woman-dies-collision-surrey-b-000624055.html" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.

The IIO, as B.C.’s civilian police watchdog, confirmed investigators were sent to the scene, while police said more information would be provided soon <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p></div>

<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Scene details: Police tape cordoned off part of a Chevron gas station at 108 Avenue and 132 Street, where evidence markers and items of clothing were visible on the ground <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Leaving station: One report described the crash as involving a Surrey police vehicle leaving a gas station when the pedestrian was hit <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/british-columbia/female-pedestrian-killed-in-crash-with-surrey-police-vehicle-leaving-gas-station/article_5b5f874b-5eb0-5e23-8a6e-5e5ba5a19f01.html" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Earlier fatality: Surrey police referenced a Dec. 14 incident where a female pedestrian was killed at 152nd Street and 64th Avenue after being struck by a Surrey police cruiser <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>


<li><strong>Christmas morning:</strong> Collision occurred near 132 Street and 108 Avenue around 6 a.m. <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a></li>



<li><strong>Dec. 14:</strong> Earlier fatal pedestrian collision involved Surrey police cruiser at 152nd and 64th <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a></li>


</ul>




<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Independent Investigations Office (IIO): B.C.’s civilian police watchdog investigates incidents involving police where someone is seriously harmed or dies, and it confirmed investigators attended this scene <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Police-related incident: In this case, Surrey police characterized the crash as a police-related incident and reported notifying the IIO after the cruiser struck a pedestrian <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Police oversight: The IIO investigation means an external civilian body will examine the circumstances of the collision, reflecting the role of independent oversight when a police vehicle is involved in a death <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>













<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What information typically comes next in an IIO crash investigation?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The IIO generally confirms investigators have been deployed and may later release limited updates, but in this case it said it would not provide more details immediately <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What details have officials not yet publicly shared about the Christmas Day collision?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Reports said the IIO declined to release additional details beyond confirming investigators were sent, and Surrey police said more information would follow <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>






<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Avoid the taped-off area if you’re nearby: Give investigators space and follow detours around the 10800 block of 132 Street near 108 Avenue, where police tape was reported at the scene <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/iio-investigating-police-related-incident-in-surrey" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>
