<h1>Big Tech moves $120bn AI data-centre debt off books</h1>




<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> AI</p>







<div class='summary'><p>Big tech groups have increasingly financed AI-focused data centres using structures that shift roughly $120bn of related debt off their balance sheets, according to the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Separately, TechCrunch argues that 2025 was the year data centres moved from a background utility to a headline concern, as the AI boom made power, land, and build-outs central to strategy discussions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. Together, the coverage highlights a fast-growing AI infrastructure buildout that is creating new ways to fund capacity—while also pushing data-centre economics and constraints into the spotlight for the broader tech ecosystem <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p></div>

<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> A company can have significant “debt-like” obligations even when its balance-sheet debt appears modest, because guarantees and long-term contractual commitments may sit in disclosures rather than headline debt totals [common].</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Financing shift: The FT describes companies using deal structures that can keep large chunks of data-centre borrowing off corporate balance sheets, changing how investors and lenders may assess leverage and risk in AI infrastructure expansion <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>New bottlenecks: TechCrunch says the AI wave has made data-centre constraints—especially electricity access and related infrastructure—board-level issues rather than back-office logistics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Industry spotlight: TechCrunch frames data centres as newly “center stage,” reflecting how AI demand has elevated the sector’s visibility with policymakers, utilities, and local communities that host new facilities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Investor reading: The FT’s focus on off-balance-sheet debt underscores that understanding AI “capacity” now requires reading footnotes and partner arrangements, not just headline capex or reported net debt <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Perspectives</h2>


<div class='perspective'><p>Financial Times analysis: Large AI data-centre buildouts are increasingly financed in ways that move sizable related debt off corporate balance sheets, altering how the obligations appear in standard financial statements <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

<div class='perspective'><p>TechCrunch analysis: Data centres have become a central tech storyline in 2025 as AI growth shifts attention to physical infrastructure realities like power and facility development <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Off-balance-sheet financing: A set of funding structures where obligations tied to a project may not appear as debt on the sponsor’s balance sheet, depending on control and accounting rules—highlighted by the FT in the context of AI data-centre buildouts <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>AI data centre: A data-centre facility built or upgraded to host large-scale AI compute; TechCrunch describes these facilities as newly central to tech strategy in 2025 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Utilities and grids: TechCrunch notes that power availability has become a defining constraint, pulling electric utilities and grid planning into the center of AI expansion discussions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Real estate and construction: As data centres become more prominent, site selection, permitting, and construction timelines increasingly shape how quickly AI capacity can come online, according to TechCrunch’s framing of 2025’s shift <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Capital markets: The FT reports that tech groups are using financing approaches that shift data-centre debt off balance sheets, creating more deal flow for lenders and structured-finance players while complicating straightforward comparisons of corporate leverage <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>







<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Data centres traditionally sat “behind the scenes” for most consumer tech, but the rise of modern AI has increased demand for specialized compute and the facilities that house it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. In corporate finance, companies have long used project-finance and similar structures to fund capital-intensive assets while separating some debt from the parent company’s balance sheet, depending on accounting treatment and control terms [common].</p>







<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What kinds of entities or deal structures are being used to keep data-centre debt off balance sheets?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The FT describes tech groups shifting data-centre borrowing off balance sheets through structured arrangements tied to AI facilities, though the specific structure depends on control and accounting treatment <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What indicators best reveal whether AI data-centre growth is hitting power limits?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Useful signals include utility interconnection queues, substation and transmission upgrade plans, and permitting timelines, since TechCrunch highlights electricity access as a key constraint bringing data centres into the spotlight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p>

</div>






<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Stress-test your AI exposure for hidden leverage: If you own data-centre landlords, AI-heavy cloud providers, or big tech, read the notes for unconsolidated entities, guarantees, and long-term commitments; the FT highlights off-balance-sheet financing as a growing feature of AI data-centre expansion <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ae9d6cd-6b94-4e22-a559-f047734bef83" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Track local data-centre planning in your area: Check your city/county planning portal for new data-centre permits and utility interconnection filings; TechCrunch describes power and build-outs as central constraints, and local approvals often reveal what is actually getting built <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>
