<div class='summary'><p>The Education Department says it will restart wage garnishment for federal student-loan borrowers who are in default, with the first round of notices planned for the week of Jan. 7, 2026 <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/trump-administration-says-it-will-begin-garnishing-wages-of-student-loan-borrowers-in-default" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-borrowers-default-wages-garnished-2026/" class="footnote-ref">[9]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Officials say the rollout will start with roughly 1,000 borrowers and expand month by month, and that borrowers will get notice and a chance to repay before garnishment begins <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.

</blockquote>




<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> NPR reported that borrowers in default have not faced wage-garnishment risk since the pandemic-era policy changes paused the practice <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/23/nx-s1-5653312/student-loans-default-education-department" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a>.</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Default definition: The coverage explains that federal borrowers generally enter default after being more than 270 days past due, a threshold that determines when tools like wage garnishment can be used <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/trump-administration-says-it-will-begin-garnishing-wages-of-student-loan-borrowers-in-default" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Notice rules: The department must provide a 30-day warning before wages can be garnished, a procedural safeguard highlighted across reports <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Scale of defaults: Media reports cite department data showing more than 5 million borrowers currently in default, underscoring how many households could be affected by renewed collections <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/23/nx-s1-5653312/student-loans-default-education-department" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a>.</li>

<li>Earlier collections: Before wage garnishment ramps up, the administration had already restarted collections in 2025 through intercepting tax refunds and other federal payments to some borrowers with defaulted loans <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Payment pause context: Reports note that pandemic-era policy largely halted referrals of defaulted federal student loans for collection starting in March 2020, meaning many borrowers have not faced garnishment risk for several years <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/23/nx-s1-5653312/student-loans-default-education-department" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a>.</li>

</ul>

<li><strong>Week of January 7:</strong> Education Department plans first wave of wage-garnishment notices <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/trump-administration-says-it-will-begin-garnishing-wages-of-student-loan-borrowers-in-default" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Student-loan default: The department and major outlets describe default status as typically triggered once a federal borrower is more than 270 days behind on payments, which unlocks stronger collection tools <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/trump-administration-says-it-will-begin-garnishing-wages-of-student-loan-borrowers-in-default" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>.</li>

<li>Wage garnishment notice: Before wages are withheld, the government must provide advance notice (reported as 30 days) and a chance for borrowers to address the debt <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>.</li>

<li>Paycheck withholding level: One report cites the federal student-aid website as saying up to 15% of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck can be taken after certain deductions like taxes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Household budgets: Because the policy targets borrowers already in default, renewed wage withholding could tighten take-home pay for some workers, potentially reducing spending power and increasing demand for lower-cost credit alternatives <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/23/nx-s1-5653312/student-loans-default-education-department" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>.</li>

<li>Servicing and collections: Scaling up notices month by month implies growing operational volume for federal contractors and systems that manage outreach, repayment setup, and compliance with required notice procedures <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>.</li>

<li>Employers and payroll: As garnishments resume, employers and payroll providers may face more processing tasks tied to withholding orders, similar to other court- or agency-directed deductions [common].</li>

</ul>







<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Federal student-loan collections changed sharply during the pandemic, when the government paused many repayment and collection activities beginning in March 2020 <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/23/nx-s1-5653312/student-loans-default-education-department" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a>. Payments later resumed in October 2023, and the prior administration extended a one-year grace period designed to ease borrowers back into repayment <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Separately, the prior administration attempted broad student-debt forgiveness multiple times, but those efforts were blocked by courts, leaving repayment and collections as the main policy levers <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>







<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which borrowers are most likely to be chosen for the first wave of notices?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The department said the first batch will include about 1,000 borrowers but did not describe the selection criteria in the reports provided <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What specific steps can a borrower take to stop wage garnishment once a notice arrives?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The department says garnishment follows notice and an opportunity to repay, but the articles do not detail the exact stop-garnishment steps beyond contacting the system to repay or resolve the default <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Watch for a garnishment notice and respond quickly: If you are in default, look out for the department’s notice (reports say a required warning period applies) and use the response window to contact your servicer or the Education Department to set up repayment options before withholding begins <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/trump-plan-garnish-wages-student-loan-borrowers-default-response/" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/23/student-loan-wages-garnished/" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Confirm your loan status and contact details: Check whether your federal loans are current, delinquent, or in default and ensure your mailing address is up to date so you receive time-sensitive notices <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wage-garnishment-for-defaulted-student-loan-borrowers-begins-early-january-2025-12" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/business/student-loan-debtors-default-wages-garnish.html" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a>.</li>
