<h1>Regina authorities investigate apartment carbon monoxide death</h1>




<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> Canada</p>







<div class='summary'><p>Regina officials are investigating a carbon monoxide incident at a multi-family building on the 1800 block of Albert Street after first responders found two residents unconscious, with one pronounced dead at the scene and the other taken to hospital in critical condition <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11589032/regina-carbon-monoxide-death/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.

<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> The City of Regina noted carbon monoxide is colourless and odourless, making working detectors especially important for early warning <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Work underway: CBC reported the carbon monoxide spread through the building while maintenance work was being done <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-carbon-monoxide-death-9.7026865" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Multi-agency probe: The City of Regina said the investigation involves Regina Police Service, the city fire department, the Technical Safety Authority of Saskatchewan, and the Saskatchewan Coroners Service <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Family remembrance: From hospital, Sergio Losco described his son as “brilliant and kind” and said the 11-year-old loved soccer <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/saskatchewan/man-woke-in-regina-hospital-to-learn-son-11-died-from-carbon-monoxide-leak/article_0cd57e71-faa6-543a-aab1-fcd3c4bf106f.html" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a>.</li>

<li>Community support: A GoFundMe was launched to help the family following the carbon monoxide death, reflecting an outpouring of local support <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11589032/regina-carbon-monoxide-death/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Detector guidance: The City of Regina reminded residents that homes with fuel-burning appliances or attached garages need carbon monoxide detectors, placed outside sleeping areas and on every level with a fuel-burning appliance, and that alarms should never be ignored <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>


<li><strong>Friday night:</strong> Firefighters and EMS responded to two unconscious residents <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Saturday:</strong> City said impacted residents were cleared to return home <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Monday:</strong> City issued update: source shut down; investigation continuing <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Dec. 19:</strong> CBC reported Henry Losco died in the apartment <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-carbon-monoxide-death-9.7026865" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Carbon monoxide (CO): Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that people may not notice without a detector, which is why the city urged residents to rely on functioning alarms for protection <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Detector placement: Regina’s guidance says detectors should be installed outside each sleeping area and on every level that contains a fuel-burning appliance, with regular testing and battery replacement <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Source isolation: The city said fire crews worked with gas inspectors to identify and shut down the carbon monoxide source, while investigators work to determine what failed <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Rental housing safety: The case highlights the importance of carbon monoxide detection and safe operation of fuel-burning systems in multi-family buildings, as responders detected dangerous CO levels and investigators are examining the failure’s cause <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Maintenance practices: CBC’s reporting that the leak spread while maintenance work was underway may increase attention on contractor oversight and safety checks during building work involving fuel-burning equipment <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-carbon-monoxide-death-9.7026865" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Scientific Significance</h2><ul>

<li>Why detectors matter: Because carbon monoxide is not detectable by human senses, early warning depends heavily on alarms, aligning with the city’s emphasis that a functioning detector is the best protection <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>[common].</li>

<li>Exposure risk: The incident underscores how quickly high indoor concentrations can overwhelm occupants—first responders found residents unconscious and officials reported “dangerous levels” in the building <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11589032/regina-carbon-monoxide-death/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

</ul>










<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which building systems were being worked on when the carbon monoxide spread?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The articles say maintenance work was being done, but they do not specify which system or equipment was involved <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-carbon-monoxide-death-9.7026865" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Technical Safety Authority of Saskatchewan’s role in an incident like this?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The city listed it among the agencies involved in the investigation, but the articles do not detail its specific responsibilities in this case <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What support options are available for the family beyond the fundraiser?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The coverage highlights a GoFundMe, but it does not describe additional formal supports (such as victim services or housing assistance) <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11589032/regina-carbon-monoxide-death/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</p>

</div>






<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Check your carbon monoxide detector setup: Install detectors outside each sleeping area and on every level with a fuel-burning appliance, then test them regularly and replace batteries as needed <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Take alarms seriously: Never ignore a carbon monoxide alarm; leave the area and seek help right away <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/investigation-underway-after-death-in-regina-building-where-carbon-monoxide-detected" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>
