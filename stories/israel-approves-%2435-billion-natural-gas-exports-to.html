    <h1>Israel approves $35 billion natural gas exports to Egypt</h1>
<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> World</p>
<div class='summary'><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved an export permit for a long‑term agreement to supply natural gas from Israel’s offshore Leviathan field to Egypt, in what he called the largest gas deal in the country’s history, valued at roughly $35 billion over 15 years [nytimes.com#1][ft.com#1][apnews.com#1][al-monitor.com#1]. The gas will be produced by a consortium led by US energy company Chevron and Israeli partners and shipped by pipeline to Egypt, which already imports Israeli gas for its domestic market and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants on the Mediterranean [thehindu.com#1][nytimes.com#1][al-monitor.com#1]. Netanyahu said the agreement will generate tens of billions of shekels in revenue for Israel’s state budget and bolster spending on services such as education, health, infrastructure and security, while strengthening Israel’s position as a regional energy supplier [newarab.com#1][timesofisrael.com#1]. The deal moved forward after months of delay and discussions with Washington, and some Israeli civil society groups have urged the government to publish more details, including implications for domestic gas reserves and household prices [ft.com#1][newarab.com#1].</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Today, I approved the largest gas deal in Israel&#x27;s history.</p><cite>— Benjamin Netanyahu (The New Arab)</cite></blockquote>
<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> Gas typically supplies around 70 percent of Israel’s electricity generation, making decisions about export volumes especially important for its domestic power security [nytimes.com#1].</p></div>
<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Deal structure: The arrangement increases total contracted volumes from the Leviathan field to Egypt to about 130 billion cubic metres over its term, building on previous supply agreements between NewMed Energy and Egyptian buyers announced earlier this year [newarab.com#1][al-monitor.com#1].</li>
<li>Chevron’s role: US-based Chevron, which holds a major stake in Leviathan, will operate the field and coordinate exports with its Israeli partners under the newly approved permit, reinforcing its position as a key Eastern Mediterranean gas producer [thehindu.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</li>
<li>Israeli budget gains: Netanyahu said the state expects to receive around 58 billion shekels in revenue from the agreement, a sum he presented as earmarked to support public services and long‑term national projects [newarab.com#1].</li>
<li>Regulatory assurances: NewMed Energy’s chief executive said the decision marks “a historic day for the natural gas sector” that provides regulatory stability for future investment and development of Israel’s offshore fields [newarab.com#1][al-monitor.com#1].</li>
<li>Transparency concerns: The Movement for Quality Government, an Israeli NGO, expressed concern about how the agreement was approved and called on authorities to disclose its terms and the projected impact on long‑term reserves and consumer pricing [newarab.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perspectives</h2>
<div class='perspective'><p>Israeli government: Netanyahu framed the deal as a historic milestone that will strengthen Israel’s economy, fund public services and consolidate the country’s status as a regional energy power.</p>

<div class='perspective'><p>Egyptian energy sector: Egyptian authorities have sought additional Israeli gas supplies to support domestic consumption and feed LNG export facilities, using their existing infrastructure to re-export some volumes to global markets.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>
<li><strong>August:</strong> Israeli firm NewMed Energy announces long-term gas supply agreement framework with Egyptian buyers valued around $35 billion [newarab.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Earlier this year:</strong> Israel’s energy minister raises concerns about domestic pricing and fair supply, contributing to delays in approving increased exports [timesofisrael.com#1][ft.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Netanyahu grants export permit for Leviathan gas to Egypt, calling it Israel’s largest-ever gas deal [nytimes.com#1][apnews.com#1][newarab.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>
<li>Leviathan gas field: Leviathan is an offshore natural gas reservoir in the Mediterranean off northern Israel, which already supplies much of Israel’s electricity and serves as a primary source for export contracts with Egypt and other neighbors [nytimes.com#1][thehindu.com#1].</li>
<li>Gas export permit: The Israeli government’s export permit authorizes the Leviathan consortium, led by Chevron, to increase volumes sold abroad, a regulatory step required before previously announced commercial agreements can fully take effect [nytimes.com#1][ft.com#1].</li>
<li>Egyptian LNG facilities: Egypt imports pipeline gas, including from Israel, and uses liquefaction plants on its Mediterranean coast to cool the gas into LNG for shipment to overseas customers, leveraging infrastructure that smaller neighbors such as Israel do not possess [nytimes.com#1][al-monitor.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>
<li>Eastern Mediterranean energy trade: By locking in additional volumes from Leviathan to Egypt, the agreement strengthens the Eastern Mediterranean’s role as a supplementary gas source for global markets that can feed into Egyptian LNG exports, adding resilience to supply chains beyond traditional producers like Russia and the Gulf states [nytimes.com#1][al-monitor.com#1].</li>
<li>Israeli domestic energy market: Increased exports raise questions about how much gas remains available for Israel’s own long-term electricity needs and whether domestic consumers will see higher or more stable prices, prompting watchdog groups to push for clearer disclosure of reserve and pricing assumptions [timesofisrael.com#1][newarab.com#1].</li>
<li>Regional economic cooperation: The deal deepens economic interdependence between Israel and Egypt, potentially encouraging further cross-border infrastructure projects and investment in shared energy networks across the Eastern Mediterranean [al-monitor.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Large offshore gas discoveries such as the Leviathan field, found in the late 2000s in Israel’s Mediterranean waters, turned the country from an energy importer into a producer with export potential [nytimes.com#1][common]. Over the past decade, Israel and Egypt have steadily expanded energy ties, including previous agreements to send Israeli gas to Egypt for domestic use and LNG exports, positioning the Eastern Mediterranean as an emerging gas corridor connecting regional producers with global markets [nytimes.com#1][al-monitor.com#1].</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How might this deal influence future exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The long-term export framework gives producers clearer revenue visibility, which can encourage further exploration and appraisal drilling in neighboring blocks as companies seek to replicate Leviathan’s scale and feed additional volumes into Egypt’s LNG system [al-monitor.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What role do Israeli NGOs play in monitoring large resource deals like this?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Groups such as the Movement for Quality Government lobby for transparent approval processes, public access to contract terms and analysis of how big export agreements will affect strategic reserves and consumer prices, aiming to ensure that resource revenues benefit the wider population [newarab.com#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does Egypt balance imported gas with its own production?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Egypt combines domestic output with imported pipeline gas, including from Israel, to meet local demand and maximize throughput at its LNG plants, allowing it to adjust import levels depending on its own production and export opportunities [nytimes.com#1][al-monitor.com#1].</p>
