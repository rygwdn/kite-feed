<div class='summary'><p>Environment Canada advisories and warnings covered wide swaths of the country over Christmas Day, with winter storm and blizzard conditions forecast for parts of Newfoundland and Labrador and northeastern Quebec, and extreme cold flagged across much of Canada <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-newfoundland-labrador-winter-storm-warning-severe-weather/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. In Newfoundland and Labrador, strong winds and heavy snowfall along coastal areas created difficult travel and visibility conditions, and power outages left thousands without electricity <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-newfoundland-labrador-winter-storm-warning-severe-weather/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.

<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> Boxing Day is a statutory holiday in several Canadian provinces and is traditionally one of the busiest travel and shopping days of the season [common].</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Snow totals: Environment Canada forecast significant snowfall—up to about 30 cm in parts of Newfoundland and Labrador and northeastern Quebec—along with strong winds that can produce blizzard conditions <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Ontario icing: The weather setup also included freezing rain risk in parts of Ontario, a hazard that can quickly make roads and sidewalks slick and disrupt travel plans <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>West deep freeze: In Western Canada, forecasts emphasized extreme cold and wind chills during the holiday period, underscoring frostbite risk for anyone outdoors for long periods <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Coastal punch: On the East Coast, the combination of wind and heavy snow was expected to reduce visibility and create drifting, particularly in exposed coastal areas of Newfoundland and Labrador <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Perspectives</h2>


<div class='perspective'><p>Environment Canada: Weather alerts and forecasts highlighted multiple hazards at once—blizzard conditions in the East, freezing rain potential in Ontario, and extreme cold in the West—urging the public to prepare for rapidly changing conditions.</p>

</div>



<div class='perspective'><p>Residents and utilities in Newfoundland and Labrador: Reports noted that thousands lost electricity as the storm moved through, pointing to real-life disruptions beyond travel concerns.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Blizzard conditions: Environment Canada uses the term when strong winds combine with falling or blowing snow to sharply reduce visibility; this was cited as a risk for northern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador into Boxing Day <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Freezing rain: Freezing rain occurs when liquid rain freezes on contact with cold surfaces, creating ice that can make roads and sidewalks hazardous; it was part of the Ontario forecast <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Electric utilities: Power outages affecting thousands in Newfoundland and Labrador can strain repair crews and restoration timelines, particularly when high winds and blowing snow complicate access <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-newfoundland-labrador-winter-storm-warning-severe-weather/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>

<li>Holiday travel: Blizzard conditions in parts of the East and freezing rain potential in Ontario can lead to slower highway travel and interruptions to holiday plans, including delayed trips and last-minute cancellations <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a><a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>













<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which parts of Newfoundland and Labrador were most exposed to the strongest coastal winds?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The coverage emphasizes coastal impacts and widespread warnings, but the articles do not specify a single municipality as the most exposed area <a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How long were blizzard conditions expected to persist in northern Quebec?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The forecast described blizzard conditions continuing until Boxing Day for northern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p>

</div>






<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Check your local Environment Canada alert status before heading out: Use the Environment Canada alert page or weather app alerts to confirm whether you are under a warning, watch, or advisory, especially in Newfoundland and Labrador, northeastern Quebec, and parts of Ontario <a href="https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/national-news/2025/12/25/christmas-cold-for-the-west-freezing-rain-in-ontario-and-winter-storms-in-the-east/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a><a href="https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/much-of-nl-under-winter-storm-warnings-as-heavy-snow-and-winds-hit-the-coast-11670182" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Prepare for short power interruptions at home: Charge phones/power banks and keep flashlights handy if you live in storm-affected parts of Newfoundland and Labrador where outages were reported <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-newfoundland-labrador-winter-storm-warning-severe-weather/" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>.</li>
