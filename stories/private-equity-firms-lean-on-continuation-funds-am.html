<div class='summary'><p>Several reports say parts of the private-equity industry are under pressure because buyout firms have struggled to sell portfolio companies, limiting the cash they can return to clients <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. One workaround drawing heightened scrutiny is the use of “continuation funds,” where a firm sells an asset from an older fund into a new vehicle it also manages, effectively moving the company “to themselves” while generating liquidity for some investors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Separately, returns at many private-equity firms have lagged public stock markets, which has made the asset class look less dazzling than during its boom years <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. The brighter note for investors: the increased attention is pushing for clearer pricing, stronger governance, and more transparent deal terms—changes that can improve trust and long-run capital allocation if they stick <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p></div>

<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> An IPO is one of the traditional exit routes private-equity firms use to return capital to investors [common].</p></div>




<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>

<li>Circular deal risk: The New York Times describes investor concerns that continuation-fund transactions can create conflicts of interest because the same firm may influence the sale process, valuation, and fee streams on both sides of the deal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Exit bottleneck: Both outlets tie the surge in these structures to a tougher environment for traditional exits, as firms have had difficulty selling portfolio companies in normal M&amp;A or IPO channels <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Public market comparison: The Seattle Times says many private-equity funds have posted returns that trail the stock market, challenging the long-held pitch that private equity reliably outperforms after fees <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Investor pushback: The New York Times reports that some investors are warning about deeper structural issues in the industry as continuation vehicles become a bigger part of how firms deliver distributions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Perspectives</h2>


<div class='perspective'><p>Institutional investors and critics: Some investors argue that selling assets into continuation vehicles can look like “circular” dealing and may mask the difficulty of achieving clean exits, raising questions about valuation discipline and governance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sources:</strong>


<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html">The New York Times</a>


</p>

</div>



<div class='perspective'><p>Private-equity industry view (as described): Continuation funds are presented as a practical tool to deliver liquidity when external buyers are scarce and to give investors choices—either cash out or roll into a new vehicle that holds the asset longer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</p>

</div>



<div class='perspective'><p>Market commentators: Weak relative performance versus public equities is shifting perceptions of private equity from a must-have allocation to an asset class that needs to re-earn its premium through better results and clearer accountability <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>

<li>Continuation fund: A continuation fund is a new private-equity vehicle that buys one or more assets from an older fund—sometimes from the same manager—allowing some investors to sell while others stay invested longer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>GP-led secondary transaction: These continuation deals are typically “GP-led,” meaning the general partner (the buyout firm) initiates the sale and sets terms that existing limited partners can accept (roll) or decline (cash out) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

<li>Conflicts of interest: Because the manager may effectively sit on both sides of the transaction, investors and observers scrutinize how valuations are set, what fees apply, and whether independent checks are strong enough to protect limited partners <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>

<li>Limited partners: Pensions, endowments, and other investors may face slower distributions and tougher reinvestment decisions as exit delays and continuation options reshape cash-flow planning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Private credit and lenders: When exits are harder, portfolio companies may rely longer on refinancing and debt management, which can increase the importance of credit markets that support sponsor-owned firms [common]<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Deal advisory ecosystem: More GP-led secondary activity can shift work toward advisers, secondary buyers, and valuation specialists, while also raising demand for stronger governance processes around pricing and conflicts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

</ul>







<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>Private equity grew rapidly over the past few decades by buying companies, improving operations, and exiting through sales or IPOs, often marketing the promise of outperformance versus public markets [common]. When exit markets slow, funds can hold companies longer and delay distributions, which increases pressure to find alternative routes to liquidity [common]. The recent focus on continuation funds reflects that broader shift in how private assets are managed during periods when traditional dealmaking becomes harder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>







<h2>Q&A</h2>


<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What investor protections are typically used to reduce conflicts in GP-led continuation deals?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Common protections include independent valuation work, fairness opinions, and advisory-committee oversight, all aimed at reducing conflict risks when a manager orchestrates a sale into a vehicle it also runs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why does underperformance versus public stocks matter more for private equity than for mutual funds?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Private equity usually involves long lockups and higher fee layers, so lagging public-market results can make the tradeoff less attractive for investors who could otherwise hold low-cost index funds with daily liquidity <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>[common].</p>

</div>



<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Who typically buys assets in continuation funds besides existing investors who roll?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The New York Times describes these deals as a way to bring in new capital while offering liquidity to some current investors, implying participation from secondary-market investors alongside rolling limited partners <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</p>

</div>






<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>

<li>Ask your retirement plan how it oversees private equity: Request plain-language details on valuation policies, conflict-of-interest controls for GP-led deals, and how performance is benchmarked against public markets and fees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/once-wall-streets-high-flyer-private-equity-loses-its-luster/" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>.</li>

<li>Map your liquidity expectations: If you invest via a fund-of-funds, endowment, or private-wealth program, compare expected distribution schedules against actual cash flows and identify whether continuation vehicles are a growing share of realizations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/business/private-equity-continuation-funds.html" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>.</li>

The recent focus on continuation funds reflects that broader shift in how private assets are managed during periods when traditional dealmaking becomes harder [nytimes.com#1].",

Separately, returns at many private-equity firms have lagged public stock markets, which has made the asset class look less dazzling than during its boom years [seattletimes.com#1].
