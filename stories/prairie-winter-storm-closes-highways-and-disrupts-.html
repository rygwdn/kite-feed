    <h1>Prairie winter storm closes highways and disrupts flights</h1>
<p class='category'><strong>Category:</strong> Canada</p>
<div class='summary'><p>A powerful winter storm swept across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba on Wednesday, bringing heavy snow, strong winds and whiteout conditions that shut down major highways and disrupted air travel across the Prairies [nationalobserver.com#1][thestar.com#2][theglobeandmail.com#1]. Drivers were urged to avoid non-essential travel, with RCMP in Alberta warning against being on any highways as visibility dropped to near zero in many areas [cbc.ca#1][google.com#1]. Airports in Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg reported widespread delays and some temporary suspensions of arrivals and departures as crews worked to keep runways clear [theglobeandmail.com#1][google.com#1]. The same storm system, described by Environment Canada as capable of producing blizzard conditions and bitter wind chills, is now tracking east into Ontario and Quebec, where snowfall and strong winds are expected to continue into Thursday [thestar.com#1][thestar.com#2].</p></div>
<div class='did-you-know'><p><strong>Did you know:</strong> The storm stretched far enough that Calgary initially sat on the dividing line between warm Chinook conditions and the heavy snowfall band, making it unclear early on whether the city would see just wind or full blizzard conditions before the system dipped southward [calgaryherald.com#1].</p></div>
<h2>Key Points</h2><ul>
<li>Prairie snowfall totals: Environment Canada said parts of the Prairies could receive roughly 20 to 30 centimetres of snow from the system, with some localized areas under blizzard warnings due to the combination of accumulation and high winds [nationalobserver.com#1][thestar.com#2].</li>
<li>Extreme wind chills: Northern regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba can expect wind chill values near –45 C through Thursday, prompting warnings about frostbite risks for anyone outdoors for even short periods [thestar.com#2][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
<li>Highway shutdowns: Sections of major routes in southern Manitoba, including multiple stretches of provincial highways, were closed as the storm rolled in, while Alberta authorities reported numerous road closures and serious visibility issues along key corridors such as Highway 2 and Highway 1 near Calgary [google.com#3][calgaryherald.com#1].</li>
<li>School and bus closures: School divisions in parts of Manitoba cancelled classes and buses for the day due to deteriorating conditions, adding to earlier reports of school closures elsewhere on the Prairies as the storm intensified [google.com#3][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
<li>Storm system reach: Meteorologists noted the storm stretched across at least four provinces and pushed farther south than initially forecast, with Calgary sitting on the edge between warmer Chinook conditions and the heavy snowfall band before the system ultimately tracked into the city [calgaryherald.com#1][thestar.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perspectives</h2>
<div class='perspective'><p>Environment and Climate Change Canada: Meteorologists with Environment and Climate Change Canada emphasized that the system had enough energy to produce widespread blizzard conditions across multiple Prairie provinces and that its track meant areas like Calgary could quickly shift from relatively calm weather into heavy snow and blowing snow as the storm dipped southward [calgaryherald.com#1][nationalobserver.com#1].</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> 
<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/calgary-road-conditions-blowing-snow-warning-winter">Calgary Herald</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>Provincial and local authorities: Police, transportation officials and municipal authorities across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba urged people to stay off highways unless absolutely necessary and highlighted that reduced visibility, drifting snow and icy surfaces were leading to collisions, stuck vehicles and the need for plows and emergency crews to work without additional traffic on the roads [cbc.ca#1][google.com#3][theglobeandmail.com#1].</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong>

</p>
</div>
<div class='perspective'><p>Airport operators: Airports in Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg reported that strong winds and heavy snow forced delays and, in some cases, temporary suspensions of flights, but said crews were working to clear runways and resume operations once conditions allowed [theglobeandmail.com#1][google.com#1].</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Storm system delivers heavy snow and strong winds across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, triggering travel warnings and blizzard conditions [nationalobserver.com#1][thestar.com#2][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
<li><strong>Through Thursday:</strong> Environment Canada expects bitter wind chills near –45 C in northern Prairie regions and continuing snowfall and winds as the storm moves into Ontario and Quebec [thestar.com#1][thestar.com#2].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2><ul>
<li>Blizzard warning: A blizzard warning from Environment Canada indicates a combination of sustained strong winds and blowing snow that reduces visibility to near zero for several hours, which authorities noted in parts of the Prairies as this storm intensified [nationalobserver.com#1][thestar.com#2].</li>
<li>Wind chill value: Wind chill values such as the near –45 C expected in northern areas describe how cold it feels on exposed skin when strong winds combine with low air temperatures, increasing the risk of frostbite during Prairie cold snaps [thestar.com#2][common].</li>
<li>Blowing snow advisory: Environment Canada’s blowing snow advisories, like the one issued for the Calgary region, flag situations where loose snow on the ground is lifted by wind to significantly reduce visibility, even after the main snowfall band has moved through [calgaryherald.com#1][common].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry Impact</h2><ul>
<li>Air travel and airports: Flight delays and temporary suspensions at major Prairie airports require airlines and airport operators to adjust schedules, deploy extra crews for snow and ice control, and manage passenger rebookings during one of the busier winter travel periods [theglobeandmail.com#1][google.com#1].</li>
<li>Road maintenance services: The widespread snowfall and highway closures increase demand on municipal and provincial snow‑clearing operations, with plow teams working extended hours to keep key corridors open once winds ease and visibility improves [calgaryherald.com#1][google.com#3].</li>
<li>Education and childcare: School and bus cancellations in Manitoba and other affected areas disrupt family routines but also demonstrate how local school boards use weather‑related closures to prioritize student safety during severe winter events [google.com#3][theglobeandmail.com#1].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Historical Background</h2><p>The Canadian Prairies regularly experience strong winter storm systems driven by Arctic air masses meeting Pacific or mid‑latitude moisture, which can generate blizzards, ground blizzards and extreme wind chills [common]. Environment Canada has long used blizzard, winter storm and blowing snow warnings to alert residents in these provinces, and similar multi‑province systems in past years have closed highways, disrupted flights and prompted advice for people to stay home until conditions improve [common][theglobeandmail.com#1].</p>
<h2>Q&A</h2>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> How did the storm affect smaller regional airports and remote communities?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> While the articles highlight major airports in Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, they do not provide detailed information on smaller regional facilities or remote communities, though those areas are likely experiencing similar visibility and access challenges given the storm’s broad footprint [theglobeandmail.com#1][nationalobserver.com#1].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> What specific criteria does Environment Canada use to upgrade from a winter storm warning to a blizzard warning?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The coverage notes that some areas were under blizzard warnings but does not list numeric thresholds; generally, Environment Canada bases such upgrades on a combination of sustained high winds, very low visibility and duration, with local forecasters assessing conditions as storms evolve [nationalobserver.com#1][common].</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'><p><strong>Q:</strong> Which Prairie regions are expected to see the strongest rebound in temperatures after the storm?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The articles describe the current cold and wind chill values but do not provide detailed post‑storm temperature forecasts by region, indicating only that the severe cold in northern areas is expected to persist through Thursday before conditions gradually moderate [thestar.com#2][theglobeandmail.com#1].</p>
</div>
<h2>Action Items</h2><ul>
<li>Prepare a home winter safety kit: As similar storms are common on the Prairies, assemble supplies such as non‑perishable food, extra blankets, flashlights, batteries and any needed medications so you can comfortably stay home when authorities advise against travel [common][cbc.ca#1].</li>
<li>Map alternate commuting options: If you rely on a single highway route, identify backup options like transit, carpooling or remote‑work arrangements in advance so you can adapt quickly when roads close or visibility drops during winter storms [common][google.com#3].</li>
